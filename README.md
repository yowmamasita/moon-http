# moon-http

Crude implementation of HTTP/1.0 in [MoonScript](https://moonscript.org/)

## Setup

Check the Makefile for commands I use for development, but all I use really is `make`.

```
If you're on Linux and use watch mode (which compiles .moon files to .lua files as they are changed) you can install linotify to use inotify instead of polling.
```
